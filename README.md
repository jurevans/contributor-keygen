# contributor-keygen

This is a simple utility to generate a new mnemonic, instruct user to verify that they have saved this mnemonic, and provide
them with the public-key and address generated from that mnemonic (using default path `m/44'/877'/0'/0/0`).

## Run in debug mode

cargo run
```

## Build
